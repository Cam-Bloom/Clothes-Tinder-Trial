# Swipe Style

## Introduction

Welcome to Swipe Style, a mobile app inspired by Tinder that helps you discover new items based on your interests. With Swipe Style, you can easily find and favourite items that you like and get suggestions for similar items based on tags.

## How it works

Swipe Style works by presenting you with a series of items that you can swipe left or right on, similar to the popular dating app Tinder. If you swipe right on an item, tags associated with the item are saved in your individual user preferences object. If you swipe left, the item will be dismissed, and the tags will be removed from your user preferences, and you will be presented with the next item.

As you swipe through items, Swipe Style uses machine learning algorithms to identify tags associated with the items you like. It then suggests similar items based on these tags so you can discover even more items that match your interests. If you find an item that you like, you can add it to your favourites list, where you can easily access it later. You can also add items to your cart for purchase.

One of the unique features of Swipe Style is the way it learns from your preferences over time. As you continue to use the app and swipe on more items, Swipe Style will become better at predicting which items you are likely to be interested in. This means that over time, the suggestions that Swipe Style provides will become even more tailored to your individual preferences.

## Technology used

Swipe Style is built using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. The app uses Firebase solely for user authentication and management.

For data storage, we have used PostgreSQL, which is hosted on ElephantSQL and accessed through a Node.js API built using Express.js, the repository available [here](https://github.com/Superjim/clothes-backend), hosted on Render. Other technologies used in the development of Swipe Style include:

- Expo for development
- Axios
- React Navigation

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS installed (Latest LTS recommended)
- React Native CLI installed globally (npm install -g react-native-cli)
- Optional: Android Studio or Mac equivalent

## Installation

To install and run Swipe Style on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Install and set up the backend for this project available [here](https://github.com/Superjim/clothes-backend).
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the project dependencies by running the command npm install.
- Navigate to the utils/api.js file and replace the baseURL with http://localhost:3000/api (we didn't actually hide our API key).
- ?????????
- Somehow set up a Firebase project? Can we export Firebase settings? Is there a quick way to pass in a test user object?
- ??????
- Start the development server by running the command npx expo start.
- Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android device or run it virtually using Android Studio.
